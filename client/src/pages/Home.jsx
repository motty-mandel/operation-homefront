                    To change the lives of those who are forgotten. Those who gave their all but received nothing.< br />
                    The homeless Veteran epidemic is rampant. The ones that put their lives on the line so that we can have our freedom.
                    Weâ€™ve forgotten about them and left them fall by the wayside. <br />
                    <strong>NO MORE!</strong> <br />
                    This organization will change that by giving our heroes a place to live and employment opportunities,
                    all in the US, at the same time revitalizing American jobs and businesses.
